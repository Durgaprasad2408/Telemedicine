## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd telemedicine-portal
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Update the `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/telemedicine
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5174
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB**
   Make sure MongoDB is running on your system or update the connection string for a cloud database.

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the frontend (port 5174) and backend (port 5000) concurrently.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: Users register as either patients or doctors with role-specific information
2. **Login**: JWT tokens are issued upon successful authentication
3. **Protected Routes**: All API endpoints and frontend routes are protected based on user roles
4. **Token Refresh**: Automatic token validation and refresh handling
